Assignment title Coursework 1: Individual Web Services API Develop-
ment Project
Assignment type and
description
Coursework – individual practical project with oral
examination
Rationale
This coursework challenges you to design, implement,
and present a fully functional data-driven web API
with database integration. It assesses your ability
to apply software engineering principles to real-world
API design, justify design choices, demonstrate curios-
ity, creativity, and independence in software develop-
ment, and present your work effectively in an oral ex-
amination.
Word limit and guid-
ance
Assessment is based on a 10-minute oral examination
(5 minutes presentation + 5 minutes Q&A) supported
by submitted materials through GitHub repository,
API documentation, and technical report (maximum
5 pages).
Use of GenAI in this as-
sessment
GREEN: AI has an integral role and should
be used as part of the assessment.You can
use GenAI as a primary tool throughout the assess-
ment process. You must declare all tools used, pur-
poses, and attach examples of exported conversation
logs as supplementary material. Using GenAI for de-
bugging, planning or proof-reading is fully permitted.
Higher grades will be awarded for creative, high-level
use of GenAI (e.g., exploring alternatives, reimagining
cutting-edge solutions). Non-declared use of GenAI
constitutes academic misconduct.

1.Assignment guidance
You will develop your API individually. The assessment encourages
creativity, good design practice, and reflective learning in the era of
Generative AI (GenAI). The advent of GenAI has unlocked frontiers
once deemed unattainable. Instead of investing significant time and
effort in mastering low-level programming concepts and techniques,
computer science students and practitioners can now leverage AI to
focus on building complex, creative, and advanced solutions.
Therefore, this coursework is intentionally made open-ended to foster
independent inquiry and innovation. While students can still ground
their design and implementation in the foundational tools and technol-
ogy stacks introduced in the module, higher grades will be awarded for
solutions that demonstrate originality, advanced methodologies, and in-
tegration of contemporary technologies. Novel approaches that extend
beyond the basic requirements, such as incorporating modern frame-
works, architectural patterns, or emerging standards, will be recognised
as evidence of critical engagement and technical sophistication.
(a) Assessment Overview
Your grade will be assessed through anOral Examinationsupported
by a comprehensive review of your submitted materials. The oral exam
will last10 minutes in total, consisting of:
•5 minutes: individual presentation and demonstration of your
project.
•5 minutes: structured questions from the examiners about your
implementation, design decisions, and supporting materials.
The coursework mark is composed of75% for content,15% for
quality of presentation, and10% for Q&A performance. Exam-
iners will review your GitHub repository (including commit history),
API documentation, and technical report before, during, and after the
oral examination. The final mark will be determined through examiner
discretion, taking into account both your oral presentation performance
and the quality of all submitted materials. You must be prepared to
answer questions about any aspect of your submission.

2.Use of GenAI
This is aGreen Light Assessment. You may use GenAI tools (e.g.
Secure Microsoft Copilot) under the following rules:
•Youmust declareall tools used, purposes, and attach some ex-
amples of exported conversation logs as supplementary material.
•Using GenAI for debugging, planning or proof-reading isfully
permitted.
•Non-declared use of GenAI constitutesacademic misconduct.
The following table shows how different levels of GenAI usage relate to
grade bands:
Grade Band GenAI Usage Level
40–49 (Pass) Generative AI is employed in an unsystematic
and arbitrary manner.
50–59 (Satisfactory) Low-level use of AI, e.g. to aid in writing or
debugging code.
60–69 (Good) Employs Generative AI in a methodologically
sound manner.
70–79 (Very Good) Medium level use of GenAI, e.g. to understand
technology and new concepts.
80–89 (Excellent) High level use of GenAI to aid creative thinking
and solution exploration.
90–100 (Outstanding) Creative application of Generative AI, such as
exploring high-level alternatives and reimagin-
ing the design of cutting-edge solutions.

3.Assessment tasks
(a) Minimum Technical Requirements
To achieve aPass (i.e. 40+), your API must at a minimum:
•implement at least one data model involving all four elements of
CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality linked
to a database. 2 You can base your design on a RESTful (Rep-
resentational State Transfer) API. However, you can also use a
GraphQL-based API if you think this is more suitable for the
problem, but you must explain the rationale for using GraphQL.
•includes at least four API endpoints accessible via HTTP requests
•handle user inputs and return appropriate JSON responses. You
are permitted to use other formats, provided you justify these in
your supporting report document.
•use correct status/error codes, according to industry convention
•be demonstrable via local execution, web hosting (e.g. Pytho-
nAnywhere), or a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.
You can base your implementation on Django, but you can also use
other suitable stacks (e.g. PythonFastAPI, Node.jsExpress, Go
Fiber). You must justify your technical choices and motivations.
(b) Example Project Ideas
•A book metadata and recommendation API integrating a public
dataset (e.g. Goodreads or Google Books) and providing analytic
endpoints such as genre trends, rating distributions, and person-
alised suggestions.
•An environmental and urban climate statistics API that stores his-
torical weather, air quality, and temperature data, enabling users
to query aggregated metrics, anomalies, and city-level trends.
•A productivity and habit analytics API that tracks tasks, habits,
time logs, and completion patterns, offering endpoints for streak
calculations, productivity heatmaps, and behavioural summaries.
2You are permitted to use any type of SQL database, but you should not use NoSQL
databases except with clear reasoning in your supporting report document.
7
•A public transport reliability and delay analytics API using open
UK transport datasets, providing CRUD for user-reported inci-
dents and endpoints for route-level reliability scores, delay pat-
terns, and temporal performance summaries.
•A nutrition and recipe analytics API backed by open food datasets
(e.g. USDA or UK FSA), supporting ingredient/recipe CRUD and
computing calories, macronutrients, allergen warnings, and cost or
difficulty estimates.
•A housing market and rental insights API integrating ONS or
Land Registry data, offering CRUD for listings and locations, plus
analytics such as median rent, affordability indices, or regional
price trends.
•A cultural events and tourism insights API using public datasets
on museums, festivals, and heritage sites, enabling CRUD for
events and providing popularity metrics, seasonal trends, and
location-based recommendations.
•A sports performance and match statistics API backed by public
sports datasets (e.g. football, cricket, or F1), supporting CRUD
for teams, players, and matches, alongside analytical endpoints
for leaderboards, performance summaries, and win probabilities.
(c) Data Sources
You are encouraged to use publicly available datasets for your project.
Below are some suggested platforms where you can access suitable data:
•Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) – Large collection
of datasets across various domains, including books, weather, health,
and more.
•data.gov.uk(https://www.data.gov.uk/) – UK government open
data portal with datasets on transport, health, education, and
public services.
•OpenWeatherMap(https://openweathermap.org/api) – Weather
data API that can be used to collect historical and current weather
information.
•Google Dataset Search(https://datasetsearch.research.
google.com/) – Search engine for publicly available datasets.
8
•UCI Machine Learning Repository(https://archive.ics.
uci.edu/) – Datasets commonly used for machine learning and
data analysis projects.
•NHS Digital(https://digital.nhs.uk/data) – Health and
care data from the UK National Health Service.
Ensure that any dataset you use is appropriately licensed for academic
use, and clearly cite the source in your technical report.
(d) Using AI to Work with Datasets
You are encouraged to leverage Generative AI tools to help you dis-
cover, process, and import datasets into your database. A recom-
mended workflow includes:
(i) Dataset Discovery:Use AI to search online for datasets in
areas you are passionate about or interested in exploring. Ask AI to
suggest relevant datasets, data sources, or domain-specific repositories.
(ii) Download and Explore:Download an interesting dataset
and examine its structure, format, and contents to understand what
data is available.
(iii) Generate Import Scripts:Provide a subset of your dataset
to AI and ask it to help you create a script to import and store the
data in your SQL database. This can significantly accelerate the data
preparation process.
This approach encourages creative exploration while demonstrating ef-
fective use of AI as a productivity tool. Remember to declare your use
of AI tools in your technical report, as outlined in Section 2.

Important Notes:
•Presentations that are overly text-heavy or read verbatim from slides
will reduce your presentation skills score.
•Students are expected to use visual elements such as screenshots, dia-
grams, or recorded demos.
•Your PowerPoint presentation should include dedicated sections cov-
ering: version control practices, API documentation, technical report
highlights, and all deliverables.
•During the examination, examiners will navigate through your GitHub
repository, review your commit history, examine your API documen-
tation, and assess your technical report while asking questions.
•After your oral presentation, you will receive detailed feedback via
email. We aim to provide feedback by email within 2 weeks of the fi-
15
nal presentation date. This timeframe allows examiners to thoroughly
review all submitted materials, apply appropriate discretion in mark-
ing, and ensure that the final grade accurately reflects both your oral
presentation performance and the quality of your complete submission.

6.Presentation and referencing
Your report and oral presentation must:
•Use clear English and professional communication.
•Be logically structured with labelled sections.
•Include diagrams where appropriate.
•Reference any libraries, tutorials, or datasets used.
The quality of written English will be assessed in this work. As a minimum,
you must ensure:
•Paragraphs are used
•There are links between and within paragraphs although these may be
ineffective at times
•There are (at least) attempts at referencing
•Word choice and grammar do not seriously undermine the meaning
and comprehensibility of the argument
•Word choice and grammar are generally appropriate to an academic
text
These are pass/fail criteria. So irrespective of marks awarded elsewhere, if
you do not meet these criteria you will fail overall.

•Leeds students are part of an academic community that shares ideas
and develops new ones.
•You need to learn how to work with others, how to interpret and present
other people’s ideas, and how to produce your own independent aca-
demic work. It is essential that you can distinguish between other
people’s work and your own, and correctly acknowledge other people’s
work.
•All students new to the University are expected to complete an online
Academic Integrity tutorial and test, and all Leeds students should
ensure that they are aware of the principles of Academic integrity.
•When you submit work for assessment it is expected that it will meet
the University’s academic integrity standards.
•If you do not understand what these standards are, or how they apply
to your work, then please ask the module teaching staff for further
guidance.
By submitting this assignment you are confirming that the work
